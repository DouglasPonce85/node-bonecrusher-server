**I'm a big "Old School" Transformer's Fan**. So probably at this point you may wondered...

| QUESTION | DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Why named it Bonecrusher?   | So here it goes as interesting for this character. Bonecrusher finds beauty in rubble-strewn wastelands and longs to transform pretty much any location he happens across into one. Moreover, he makes demolition into a wild performance art. He loves to show off his destructive talents for his fellow Decepticons. |
